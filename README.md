Learning proccess for node.js
=============================

All pushes in this repo is my own messing around with node. A lot of the file here are not original, and are modified versions taken from similar projects. Credits have been given where credits are due, at the top of the file needed.

Project is maily using node.js as a webserver. I am a long-time, experienced PHP developer, and such most of my projects are trying to replicate some of the main PHP methods.

Node.js and mongodb are the foundation (Apache&PHP / MySQL). Modules used:
* Express
* Jade
* Mongoose

Feel free to use any of the files provided for your own use.
